Start the ioc server with the command:
iocsh -r ioc_esys_freia[,version] -c "requireSnippet(esys-freia.cmd, "HOST_IPADDR=<ip_address>")"

To start it automatically on diskless target write a following in /opt/startup/ioc/<target_name>/{ioc_name}/st.cmd:

require ioc_esys_freia[,version]
requireSnippet(esys-freia.cmd, "HOST_IPADDR=<ip_address>")

Note 1:
At the moment there is a problem with having the module directory name with several "-" after m-epics part. The work around is to set the PROJECT = ioc_esys_freia in the top Makefile. It is also neccessary to change the line:
epicsEnvSet("MIBDIRS", "+$(REQUIRE_ioc_esys_freia_PATH)/misc")
in esys-freia.cmd

Note 2:
THe esys-freia-postSaveRestore.cmd and esys-freia-preSaveRestore.cmd are not used and therefore not configured properly.
